# GROUP DYNAMICS SOMETHING ? 
## The aim of this analysis will be to visualize the dialogues that take place within a frequently communicating portion of subreddits, by unraveling causes, consequences, attacks and responses between these groups that oftenly interact together.
# Research question
## What can we learn about conflicts and friendships from analyzing the dynamics that occur within a frequently interacting set of groups ?


# Specific questions and methods
Q° : What seems to bring these subreddits together ? Are they closely related or completely different ?
-> subreddit embeddings

Q° : Can we identify "troublemakers" within the population ?
-> time analysis of the initiators : find the first negative links sent that trigger a series of events

Q° : Are alliances made to coordonate/face attacks ? Are they temporary or long lasting friendships ?
-> graph analysis  ??

Q° : How long does it take for an attack to be forgiven by the receiving end ? Meaning that they start interacting positively together again.
-> temporal analysis of the sentiment of individual subreddits for other subreddits that attacked them

Q° : Can we find mechanisms that group conflicts follow that are similar to the ones in conflicts between individuals ? (peut etre too far haha)
->

Q° : Can conflicts within the population spark seemingly unrelated conflicts between other members ??

# Proposed timeline
06/11 - 12/11 : finding the target population, making more utils for time analysis, plotting, ???
13/11 - 20/11 : A DEFINIR JE SAIS PAS MOI

# Internal milestones
