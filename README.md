# Gamer gate: Hate in gamer communities, the case of the kiA subreddit
**The datastory:** https://epfl-ada.github.io/teaching/fall2025/cs401/projects/

# Abstract
The aim of this project will be to understand the events and mechanisms in and around the "Gamer gate", an online harassement campaign against feminism, diversity, and progressivism in video game culture, that was present on multiple online platforms, including reddit. We chose this topic because "Gamer gate" functions as a "model", i.e., a blueprint for the coordinated, polarized hate campaigns we see on social media today. More specifically, we want to examine the evolution of the campaign, using data to uncover how the event unfolded across the platform and how various communities responded, interacted, and influenced each other during the escalation. The goal of our project is to be able to better understand hate on the internet and maybe find mitigation strategies.

# Research questions
1. How did the gamergate events evolve over time and what can they teach us regarding misogyny in online debate ?
2. To what extent do linguistic patterns and user sentiment diverge between Pro-GamerGate (KiA) and Anti-GamerGate (GiA) communities ? How does this compare to other related subreddits ?
3. Is the hostility and negative sentiment in GamerGate debates widely distributed across the user base, or disproportionately generated by a hyper-active core of ‘super-participants’ that create the majority of posts ?
4. To what extent do Pro- and Anti-GamerGate communities function as linguistic echo chambers? Can a classifier distinguish between posts from r/KotakuInAction and r/GamerGhazi with high accuracy, indicating a distinct separation in vocabulary and rhetoric?
5. A lot of articles such as this post suggest that gamergate was just a strategy headed by extremists to spread ideas and recruit more people to their cause. Did that work out ? To which extent did the gaming community involved in the gamergate controversy get influenced towards alt-right spheres ?
# Additional datasets
**Pushshift:** this dataset been generated by pushshift, which uses the Reddit API to extract and save post data to create a snapshot of Reddit accessible to the public (obtained here). We selected the same period of time as the first dataset (Jan 2014 to April 2017). It contains a log and metadata of all posts made during the time period, including usernames, titles, post bodies and more! This enables us to do a lot more analysis on the text content (for example keyword analysis), on users, since we can track their posts using the username and total post volume over time.

To make it easier to work with the Pushshift dataset, we only kept the following attributes:

| Label | Description |
| ------- | ------- |
| **SUBREDDIT** | The subreddit of the post | 
| **USERNAME** | Username of the post author | 
| **POST_ID** | Unique id of the post |
| **TIMESTAMP** | Time of the post |
| **TITLE** | Text of the post title |
| **BODY_TEXT** | Text of the post body|
| **NUM_COMMENTS** | Number of comments under the post |

# Methods

# Proposed timeline
| **Week** |**Dates**| **Tasks** |
| :------: | :------: | ------ |
|**1** |6.11-12.11| <ul><li>Find target population for deeper analysis </li><li> Make more utils for time analysis, plotting and other general functionalities needed for the project</li></lu>|
|**2** |13.11-19.11| <ul><li>Start in-depth time analysis of our target population </li><li> Define attack/interaction window (to be able to relate interactions between two subreddits)</li></lu>|
|**3** |20.11-26.11|<ul><li>Start work on the datastory (probably with a github.io website) </li><li> Use a classifier to try to create groups for our target population (by topic, size, other metrics...) </li><li> Continue working on analyzing the target population with focus on "troublemakers" </li></lu> |
|**4** |27.11-03.12|<ul><li>Look for conflict sparking trends and possible alliances </li><li> Continue work on both data story and further analysis of the target population (bulk of our work should be this week)</li></lu>|
|**5** |4.12-10.12|<ul><li>Finalize the datastory, including text, interactive graphs and images </li><li> Wrap up analysis of our target population (time allocated for ideas not part of our initial planning) </li><li> Make sure all helpers and supporting code is mostly finalized</li></lu>|
|**6** |11.12-17.12|<ul><li>Fix bugs (if any) </li><li> Verify website layout and code clarity </li><li> Avoid adding new features/content, focus on correctness of the project</li></lu>|
